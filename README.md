# Pet Project: Video Chat

This application was made as a pet project to experiment with Astro and WebRTC.
The frontend was made using AstroJS for rendering and SolidJS for component behavior.
The backend was made with NestJS.

For comunication I am using sockets to manage chat rooms and webrtc for handling peer to peer comunication.
